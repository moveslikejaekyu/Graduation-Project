# Graduation-Project

### 1. Project's Topic 
     -> Develop model for predicting Gentrification with big-data & spatial analysis

### 2. Definition of Gentrification

  - The process of repairing and rebuilding homes and businesses in a deteriorating area (such as an urban neighborhood) 
  accompanied by an influx of middle-class or affluent people and that often results in the displacement of earlier, 
  usually poorer residents
</br>
  - The process of changing the character of a neighborhood through the influx of more affluent residents and businesses
</br>
 
 With this definition, i rewrited my own definition for Gentrification to understand phenomenon easily.
 
     -> The leaseholder(poorer people) who made deteriorating area better & characteristic are expelled 
     and displaced to middle-class people because of super high raise of monthly pay by landlord. 
     This area's character are gradually lost so people who are used to come do not come here anymore. 
     Finally the area are gonna deteriorated and both of them(landlord,leaseholder) become loser.  

### 3. Introdution
</br>
In these days, Gentrification becomes a very big & unsolvaable city problem. </br>
The city experts said "There was no solution for Gentrification and also now". </br>
Because it's a kinda natural capitalism problem and inevitable result of market principles. </br>
Even though there are regulations for increasing monthly pay super high, it doesn't work well. </br>
The worst thing is if Gentrification happen, the situation worsens at a rapid pace and became impossible to stop this with any solutions.</br>
 
 With these things, I thought if i collect big data concerned with Gentrification,
    * 1. can analyse them with time-series 
    * 2. can extract the regular pattern 
    * 3. can predict Gentrification with the pattern - catch the beginning step of Gentrification  
    * 4. can do preemptive defense before Gentrification gonna worse.
    * 5. Finally prevent Gentrification and make win-win game for landlord and leaseholder
    
 
 </br>
 With this inspiration, i collected big data concerned with Gentrification, </br>
 analysed two areas with big-data & spatial analysis and made model for catching beginning step of Gentrification! </br>
